# soccer_team_ratings

This repository contains MATLAB code for identifying the offensive and defensive ratings of soccer teams.  Using these ratings we can then provide the probabilities for the outcome of upcoming matchups.  The method we use builds on the ideas on team ratings presented in the book "Mathletics" by W. Winston and adjusted as presented in http://412sportsanalytics.wordpress.com 

The data included for demonstration are from the Greek tier-1 league (superleague).
